# NPMRDS
Wrangling some vehicle probe data from the National Performance Management Research Data Set (NPMRDS) in PostGIS. Yeehaw?

Inrix calculates some performance statistics for me, so this repository mostly tries to reverse engineer those stats or occasionally, come up with new ones that we need at TMACOG.
